//PROBLEM

/*In the ancient kingdom of Zabiria, there exists a magical gate known as the Prime Gate.

The gate reacts differently depending on the nature of the number it receives:

It opens when given a Prime number
It remains closed when given a Composite number
It stays inactive when given a number that is neither Prime nor Composite
A young programmer Omkar has been chosen to guard the gate. Every day, the gate provides a natural number.
Omkar must determine the correct nature of the number so the gate behaves accordingly.

Your task is to help Omkar by writing a program that checks whether the given number is Prime, Composite, or Neither.

Input Format

A single line containing one natural number N.

Constraints

-10^9 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10^9
Output Format

Print Prime, if the number is prime
Print Composite, if the number is composite
Print None, if the number is neither prime nor composite
Sample Input 0

7
Sample Output 0

Prime
Explanation 0

7 is a positive number greater than 1 and has only two divisors (1 and 7), so it is Prime.

Sample Input 1

10
Sample Output 1

Composite
Explanation 1

10 has more than two divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), so it is Composite.

Sample Input 2

1
Sample Output 2

None
Explanation 2

1 is neither prime nor composite, so it is None.*/

//SOLUTION

long long N;
    scanf("%lld", &N);

    if (N <= 1) {
        printf("None");
        return 0;
    }

    for (long long i = 2; i * i <= N; i++) {
        if (N % i == 0) {
            printf("Composite");
            return 0;
        }
    }

    printf("Prime");
    return 0;
